{"sentence_id": "s000004", "translation": "In the center of the town stood a tiny shop with an old wooden sign: \"H. Dalton, Clockmaker.\""}
{"sentence_id": "s000005", "translation": "Through the window, Emma saw hundreds of clocks — large and small, round and square — each showing a different time."}
{"sentence_id": "s000006", "translation": "She entered the shop, and a small bell rang above the door."}
{"sentence_id": "s000007", "translation": "Behind the counter, an old man with silver hair looked up from his work."}
{"sentence_id": "s000008", "translation": "\"Good afternoon,\" he said kindly."}
{"sentence_id": "s000009", "translation": "\"You look like you've had a long journey.\""}

{"sentence_id": "s000014", "translation": "\"Not many people visit this shop anymore.\""}
{"sentence_id": "s000015", "translation": "As she spoke, Emma noticed a clock on the wall — a tall, golden one with strange letters instead of numbers."}
{"sentence_id": "s000016", "translation": "It was stopped at 11:11."}
{"sentence_id": "s000017", "translation": "\"That clock hasn't moved in years,\" the man said quietly."}
{"sentence_id": "s000018", "translation": "\"Some things are not meant to keep time.\""}

{"sentence_id": "s000021", "translation": "He had offered her tea the day before and called a mechanic for her car."}
{"sentence_id": "s000022", "translation": "When she entered, the sound of ticking filled the air."}
{"sentence_id": "s000023", "translation": "\"Ah, Miss Emma,\" he said, smiling."}
{"sentence_id": "s000024", "translation": "\"I hoped you'd come back.\""}
{"sentence_id": "s000025", "translation": "She looked again at the golden clock."}
{"sentence_id": "s000026", "translation": "Something about it drew her closer."}

{"sentence_id": "s000028", "translation": "Mr. Dalton asked."}
{"sentence_id": "s000029", "translation": "He opened the glass door carefully and took out a folded piece of paper hidden behind the pendulum."}
{"sentence_id": "s000030", "translation": "\"I found this years ago,\" he said, handing it to her."}
{"sentence_id": "s000031", "translation": "Emma opened it and read out loud: \"To the next keeper of time — follow the sound that stops.\""}
{"sentence_id": "s000032", "translation": "\"What does it mean?\" she asked."}
{"sentence_id": "s000033", "translation": "Mr. Dalton shrugged."}
{"sentence_id": "s000034", "translation": "\"I never discovered it."}
{"sentence_id": "s000035", "translation": "But maybe you will.\""}
{"sentence_id": "s000036", "translation": "That night, in her room at the small inn, Emma couldn't sleep."}
{"sentence_id": "s000037", "translation": "She kept hearing the steady ticking of clocks in her mind — until, all at once, she imagined one of them stopping."}
{"sentence_id": "s000038", "translation": "The next day, the rain returned."}
{"sentence_id": "s000039", "translation": "Emma walked through the town square, passing the church tower and the bread shop."}
{"sentence_id": "s000040", "translation": "The air smelled of fresh bread and wet stone."}
{"sentence_id": "s000041", "translation": "She stopped near the fountain and noticed something strange — a clock hanging on the wall of an old library, completely silent."}
{"sentence_id": "s000042", "translation": "The glass was cracked, and the hands were frozen at 11:11, just like the one in Mr. Dalton's shop."}
{"sentence_id": "s000043", "translation": "Inside the library, dust floated in the air like snow."}
{"sentence_id": "s000044", "translation": "She followed the silence to a small reading room at the back, where a large wooden box stood under the window."}
{"sentence_id": "s000045", "translation": "It had the same strange symbols cut into it."}
{"sentence_id": "s000046", "translation": "Emma turned the handle, and the box opened with a click."}
{"sentence_id": "s000047", "translation": "Inside was a collection of letters tied with a blue string and a pocket watch made of gold."}
{"sentence_id": "s000048", "translation": "The watch ticked softly, but when she touched it, it stopped."}
{"sentence_id": "s000049", "translation": "At that moment, she heard Mr. Dalton's voice behind her."}
{"sentence_id": "s000050", "translation": "\"You found it,\" he said."}
{"sentence_id": "s000051", "translation": "\"I hoped someone would.\""}
{"sentence_id": "s000052", "translation": "He looked sad but peaceful."}
{"sentence_id": "s000053", "translation": "\"My father built that clock, and his father before him."}
{"sentence_id": "s000054", "translation": "Each of us waited for the sound that stopped."}
{"sentence_id": "s000055", "translation": "It means the end of our keeping.\""}
{"sentence_id": "s000056", "translation": "Emma didn't fully understand, but she felt the weight of his words."}
{"sentence_id": "s000057", "translation": "A few days later, Emma's car was repaired, but she wasn't sure she wanted to leave."}
{"sentence_id": "s000058", "translation": "Something about the town, and the clockmaker, felt unfinished."}
{"sentence_id": "s000059", "translation": "When she visited the shop again, the door was locked."}
{"sentence_id": "s000060", "translation": "A sign read: \"Closed."}
{"sentence_id": "s000061", "translation": "Thank you for your time.\""}
{"sentence_id": "s000062", "translation": "Through the window, Emma saw that all the clocks had stopped — except the golden one, which now ticked slowly, its hands moving past 11:11 for the first time."}
{"sentence_id": "s000063", "translation": "On the counter lay a small box with her name written on it."}
{"sentence_id": "s000064", "translation": "Inside was the pocket watch from the library and a short note: \"Every keeper must listen carefully."}
{"sentence_id": "s000065", "translation": "Time doesn't belong to us; it only passes through our hands.\""}
{"sentence_id": "s000066", "translation": "Emma smiled sadly."}
{"sentence_id": "s000067", "translation": "She put the watch in her coat pocket and walked outside."}
{"sentence_id": "s000068", "translation": "The sky was clearing, and the sun touched the roofs of Windmere."}
{"sentence_id": "s000069", "translation": "As she started her car, she could still hear the faint ticking — not from the clocks, but from her heart, steady and alive."}
{"sentence_id": "s000070", "translation": "Months passed."}
{"sentence_id": "s000071", "translation": "Emma returned to her job in the city, but Windmere never left her thoughts."}
{"sentence_id": "s000072", "translation": "She kept the golden watch on her desk, though it never ticked again."}
{"sentence_id": "s000073", "translation": "One morning, a small envelope arrived in her mail."}
{"sentence_id": "s000074", "translation": "Inside was a note written in neat writing: \"The Clockmaker's Workshop will reopen for one night only — Midnight, on the first of June.\""}
{"sentence_id": "s000075", "translation": "There was no signature, only the same symbol that appeared on the clock — the circle of twelve letters forming a sun."}
{"sentence_id": "s000076", "translation": "Emma hesitated."}
{"sentence_id": "s000077", "translation": "She told herself it was impossible, that the shop had been closed for good."}
{"sentence_id": "s000078", "translation": "Yet something inside her whispered that she needed to go."}
{"sentence_id": "s000079", "translation": "When Emma reached Windmere, the town looked almost the same — quiet streets, yellow lights, the smell of rain."}
{"sentence_id": "s000080", "translation": "But the shop was open, and warm light spilled through the windows."}
{"sentence_id": "s000081", "translation": "Inside, the air buzzed with the soft ticking of hundreds of clocks again."}
{"sentence_id": "s000082", "translation": "Behind the counter stood a young man she had never seen before."}
{"sentence_id": "s000083", "translation": "\"Welcome,\" he said."}
{"sentence_id": "s000084", "translation": "\"You must be Emma."}
{"sentence_id": "s000085", "translation": "Mr. Dalton spoke of you before he passed away.\""}
{"sentence_id": "s000086", "translation": "Emma felt a deep sorrow but also a strange calm."}
{"sentence_id": "s000087", "translation": "\"He left this for you,\" the man said, handing her a small wooden box."}
{"sentence_id": "s000088", "translation": "Inside was a key made of silver, shaped like a clock hand."}
{"sentence_id": "s000089", "translation": "She looked around."}
{"sentence_id": "s000090", "translation": "The golden clock stood in the same corner, shining softly."}
{"sentence_id": "s000091", "translation": "The hands were stopped once again at 11:11."}
{"sentence_id": "s000092", "translation": "The young man explained that Mr. Dalton had known his time was ending."}
{"sentence_id": "s000093", "translation": "\"He believed time itself is like music,\" he said."}
{"sentence_id": "s000094", "translation": "\"When one player stops, another begins.\""}
{"sentence_id": "s000095", "translation": "Emma turned the silver key in her fingers."}
{"sentence_id": "s000096", "translation": "\"What am I supposed to do with this?\""}
{"sentence_id": "s000097", "translation": "\"Only listen,\" he said."}
{"sentence_id": "s000098", "translation": "\"When the moment is right, you'll know.\""}
{"sentence_id": "s000099", "translation": "That night, she stayed in the old inn."}
{"sentence_id": "s000100", "translation": "As the town grew silent, she heard a soft ticking again — not from the watch, but from the walls, as if every clock in Windmere was breathing together."}
{"sentence_id": "s000101", "translation": "At midnight, the golden clock in the shop started to ring."}
{"sentence_id": "s000102", "translation": "She walked outside into the cool air and watched as the church tower lights flickered to life, one by one."}
{"sentence_id": "s000103", "translation": "The whole town seemed to wake, then slowly fall quiet again."}
{"sentence_id": "s000104", "translation": "The silver key in her hand grew warm."}
{"sentence_id": "s000105", "translation": "The next morning, the shop was empty."}
{"sentence_id": "s000106", "translation": "Dust covered the counters, and the clocks were silent once more."}
{"sentence_id": "s000107", "translation": "Only the golden clock remained, its hands pointing straight to 12:00."}
{"sentence_id": "s000108", "translation": "Emma placed the silver key into the small opening at its base."}
{"sentence_id": "s000109", "translation": "The clock began to tick — once, twice — and then all the clocks in the room started again."}
{"sentence_id": "s000110", "translation": "She smiled."}
{"sentence_id": "s000111", "translation": "Time was moving forward again."}
{"sentence_id": "s000112", "translation": "When she stepped outside, the morning sun filled the street."}
{"sentence_id": "s000113", "translation": "She could hear the faint sound of bells in the distance and felt a gentle breeze on her face."}
{"sentence_id": "s000114", "translation": "For the first time, she understood: keeping time was never about holding it still — it was about letting it go."}
{"sentence_id": "s000115", "translation": "And so Emma became the new keeper of Windmere, not by choice, but by listening to the moment that stopped and began again."}
